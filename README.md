# SolarSystem
A model of our solar system

The goal of this project is to primarily use HTML5 and CSS3 (with some JQuery) to create a horizontal website model of the universe where every-so-pixels = so many space-mesurement (AU). Images of planets will be relative (but not exact) scale. You will use a scroll feature to speed up the scroll to your chosen planet.
The Astroid Belt, with Ceres, a dwarf planet, will also be referenced.

You will see the planet spinning and any of its moons spinning around it (for those with many satellites we will use the most famous). When you hover over a moon or planet then the animation of the spinning will pause.

Moons will be css3 circles except for our moon unless desided later.

Clicking on a planet, or moon, will change to a page with information about the planet. If a moon is clicked it will go to the planet's page, to the section where its moon is described.

Information will be pulled from Wikipedia for the most part, and link to the article posted.

The home page will have links on the bottom to 'jump' to the different planets in the model. These links will be a mini linear soloar system with images. If you hover over a planet it will show its name.
In mobile, this will be hidden below with a button to pop it up.

The website's menu will be a 'hamburger' menu in the top right that will expand with links to each planet's individual page and an about page where citations will be listed and any site changes in a site log.

Individual pages will have the
name,
class (planet, dwarf, gas planet, etc),
distance from sun,
length of rotation and
revolution around sun,
and list of moons/satellites.
fun fact
Some of this will be presented in a visual manner with an image of the sun, pulsing, and the planet, spinning (in relation to how fast it spins compared to earth), with an arrow pointing with the distance from the sun and little moons spinning around it.
