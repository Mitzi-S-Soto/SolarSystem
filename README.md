# SolarSystem
A model of our solar system


Solor System Model Project


Solor System Model Project

The goal of this project is to primaraly use HTML5 and CSS3 (with some JQuery) to create a horizontal website model of the universe where every-so-pixels = so many space-mesurement (AU or miles or Light years). Images of planets will be realitive (but not exact) scale (unless we can do it easily). You will use a scroll feature to speed up the scroll to your chosen planet.
The Astroid Belt, with Ceres, a dwarf planet, will also be referenced.

You will see the planet spinning and any of its moons spinning around it (for those with many satilites we will use the most famous). When you hover over a moon or planet then the animation of the spinning will pause.

moons will be css3 circles except for our moon

Clicking on a planet, or moon, will change to a page with information about the planet. If a moon is clicked it will go to the planet's page but to the section where its moon is described.

Information will be pulled from Wikipedia for the most part, and link to the article posted.

The home page will have links on the bottom to 'jump' to the different planets in the model. These links will be a mini linar soloar system with images. If you hover over a planet it will show its name.
In mobile, this will be on the longest side. Or a seperate menu.

The website's menu will be a 'hamburger' menu in the top left that will expand with links to each planet's individual page and an about page where citations will be listed and any site changes in a site log.

Individual pages will have the
name,
class (planet, dwarf, gas planet, etc),
distance from sun,
how long of rotation and
revolution around sun,
and list of moons/satilites.
fun fact
Some of this will be presented in a visual manner with an image of the sun, pulsing, and the planet, spinning (in relation to how fast it spins compaired to earth), with an arrow pointing with the distance from the sun and little moons spinning around it.

MESURMENTS:
----
1 AU = 5,000px ex: Earth is 5,000 px from the sun. The Sun's radius is 23.5 px. Pluto is 195,000 px from the sun
1d = 0.5 sec ex: Earth will spin at 0.5 sec Venus at 121.5 sec anything under 12h spins at 0.25
1y = 1s ex: Earth will spin around the sun in 1 sec. Mercury at 0.88 sec. etc
note: moon orbits are not measured exactly and will all go the same speed.
note: Planet sizes will not be exact to scale.

note: numbred moon is the same width/height as is the number of moons

Mercury = 2000px (AU)
Venus = 3500px (AU)
Earth = 5000 (AU)
Mars  = 7500 (AU)
Asteroid Belt = 11500 (AU)
Ceres = 13850 (AU)
Jupiter = 26000 (AU)
Saturn = 75500 (AU)
Uranus = 96000
Neptune = 150500
Pluto = 195000

Sun - the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU -[ It takes the Solar System about 225–250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a galactic year)]- 28d - 8 Main Planets

Mercury- Planet  - 0.4 AU     - 87.969d - 2 m-yr - 0           - @0.055 Earth Masses it is the smallest planet
                                            ~176d
Venus  - Planet  - 0.7 AU     - 224.7d  - 243d   - 0           - is close in size to Earth (0.815 Earth masses) ; Longest rotation period and rotates opposite most other planet
                                                                
Earth  - Planet  - 1 AU       - 365.26d - 24h    - 1 Moon      - Only planet with life
Mars   - Planet  - 1.5 AU     - 687d    - 24h39m
                                          35.244s- 2 Deimos/Phobos -Planet people hope can be made habitable & subject of aliens
                                          
Asteroid belt - orbits between Mars and Jupiter, 2.3-3.3 AU
Ceres  - Dwarf  - 2.77 AU     -4.6y     - 9h4m   -0   - discovered in 1801, Ceres was consitered a planet until the 1850s as an asteroid as more asteroids were found. When the definition of a planet was defined in 2006, Ceres was declared a dwarf planet.

Jupiter- Gas   - 5.2 AU      - 11.86y   -~<10h fastest-67 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating.[88] Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.-

Saturn - Gas   -9.5 AU      -10,759 Earth days (or about  29 1⁄2 years)-10 hr 39 min 22.4 sec - aturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity.[90] Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.

Uranus - Gas  -19.2 AU -84 y-17 hours, 14 minutes- 27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.-at 14 Earth masses, is the lightest of the outer planets.
Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; 

Neptune - Gas -30.1 AU -164.79 y -16.11 h-14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen.-Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans.

Pluto & Charon - Dwarf & Moon - 39AU- 248 y - 6.39d- 5:Charon, the largest of Pluto's moons, is sometimes described as part of a binary system with Pluto, as the two bodies orbit a barycentre of gravity above their surfaces (i.e. they appear to "orbit each other"). Beyond Charon, four much smaller moons, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra, orbit within the system. - iscovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet.;
Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its "side" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.*
